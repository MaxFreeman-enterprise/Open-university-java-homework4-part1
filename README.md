# Open-university-java-homework4-part1
in this assignment we were asked to write a function that receives from the user 3 parameters one as array Filled with integers  and x and y as integers, the function needs to find and return the minimum distance betwen x and y as from indexes in the array if neither or one of them is not exists in the array then the function will return the maximum integer value in Java.

And we were also asked to analyze in this function the running time complexity of the program.
and also to analyze the space complexity of the program.
of course we was asked to do so in the minimum as possible in terms of space and time complexity.

The analysis of the running time and place complexity are written in the comments above the code.
